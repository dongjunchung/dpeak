{"name":"dPeak","tagline":"High resolution identification of protein-DNA interaction sites using ChIP-Seq","body":"dpeak\r\n=====\r\n\r\ndPeak is a statistical framework for the high resolution identification of protein-DNA interaction sites using ChIP-Seq data. It provides computationally efficient and user friendly interface to process ChIP-seq data, implement exploratory analysis, fit dPeak model, and export list of predicted binding sites for downstream analysis. You can track development of mosaics package at http://github.com/dongjunchung/dpeak. To install the development version of dpeak, it's easiest to use the devtools package:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#install.packages(\"devtools\")\r\nlibrary(devtools)\r\ninstall_github(\"dongjunchung/dpeak\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n==========\r\n\r\nChung D, Park D, Myers K, Grass J, Kiley P, Landick R, and Keles S (2013), \"dPeak: High resolution identification of transcription factor binding sites from PET and SET ChIP-Seq data,\" _PLoS Computational Biology_, 9(10): e1003246.\r\n","google":"UA-46785295-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
